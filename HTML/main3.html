            <h4><b>Why Travel To Sri Lanka?</b></h4>
            <p>Sri Lanka is one of my favourite countries in the world. There’s so much to do here, it’s simply impossible to get bored.</p>
            <p>The island has a mix of the most beautiful beaches in the world, some of the best nature available anywhere and also the friendliest people – it almost seems unfair to other countries!</p>
            <h4><b>Here are some of my favourite things to do in Sri Lanka:</b></h4>
            <p>Driving a Rickshaw around the Island with Large Minority.</p>
            <p>Climbing Adam’s Peak for sunrise</p>
            <p>Going on an Elephant or Leopard safari.</p>
